As an engineer developing web applications, I find myself to be particularly curious about the parts of our stack that we are often encouraged to just accept as part of the magic we all work with - the frameworks, tools, and protocols developed and perfected over decades by experts for smarter and more dedicated than ourselves. 
"Don't reinvent the wheel!" Reach for a tried and true library. Or, as the top SEO-optimized search results will say, _buy_ a tried and true solution!

This may be good advice when it comes to something as sensitive as authentication and authorization, but  I personally do not learn very well this way. I often need to take a system apart and put it back together, or -- even better -- build the system myself from scratch in order to really, _really_ get it. 

So for my own education and that of any other experiential learners that may come across this project, I am setting out to roll my own authentication and authorization provider from the ground up and document it all. While there is no intent to turn this project into anything serious or production-ready, I will not kneecap the experience by intentionally making a simplified, toy implementation. 

Everything will be open source and I welcome feedback on the code, its documentation, and these posts.

Let's see how far we can take it!
