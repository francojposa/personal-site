## About Me

---

I am an engineer with over four years of experience designing, writing, and testing software in Python & Golang.

I love to design and build. I am passionate about clean architecture, clean code, and idiomatic best practices.
I am biased towards minimalism and simplicity:

> _"Write programs that do one thing and do it well"_

> _"There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it._"

In my spare time, I enjoy building a deep understanding of topics across all areas of software engineering, particularly lower-level systems engineering - operating systems, compilers, protocols, and more.


## About this Site

---

As software engineers our careers are a never-ending journey of self-education, and we spend countless hours reading textbooks, documentation, guides, and forums. This content is often easy to come by, but truly excellent resources are rare and invaluable.

With this site I hope to provide high-quality, useful, and accessible software engineering resources to professionals and amateurs alike while sharpening my writing skills and leaving the Internet a little freer and more open than I found it.
